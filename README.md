# Marching Buddy Web

I'm happy to introduce Marching Buddy - a web app whose sole purpose is to help you calculate your midsets. By manually inputting your starting set, ending set, and counts for the move, Marching Buddy will compute your exact midset, step size, and the counts you cross yard lines! You are then free to copy this information down in your dot book and proceed to the next set.

Being developed with responsive web design, Marching Buddy is available for use on smartphones, tablets, desktop and laptop computers, or anything with a web browser connected to the Internet! (I see you Smart Fridge!) That being said, Marching Buddy is still a work in progress.
